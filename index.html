        <p>I have never thought much of a simple component that I interact with daily - whether it's YouTube, Wiki, Google Drive or Twitch - a search bar. Everything now has a search bar
            and it felt straightforward to use from day one. However, I also realized that I never experienced a mismatch in its design: I am a daily mouse and keyboard user. If you remove 
            one of them, how hard can it get? My intuition told me that it shouldn't be a problem, so today, we will explore how accessible a simple search bar is.

            <h2>Input checking</h2>
            <p>The first part of the experiment is to try out the search bars accross different environments. I chose the ones that I use most often, Google Drive, YouTube, and Twitch TV searches. 
                To measure their accessability, I gave all of them a go with using primarely mouse/touchpad, keyboard, or a touchscreen. My main focus points were general component behavior, capabilities, 
            how easy it is to learn and use, and how accessible it felt. You can find the report in the table below </p>
        </div>
        <div class="table">
            <table border="1">
                <tr>
                    <th></th>
                    <th>Google Drive</th>
                    <th>Twitch TV</th>
                    <th>YouTube</th>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Mouse/Touchpad</td>
                    <td>Easy to find, hover underscores slighlty
                        No way to search without a keyboard input. Text is not droppable. No right click
                        The built-in “search in Drive” text makes  it learnable; efficient 
                        Bad option for pure mouse/touchpad
                        </td>
                    <td>More highlight when search bar is active, recent prompts when clicked
                        Mouse paste works, basic right click support
                        Prompt search helps learnability, efficient, easy to recall
                        Usable with mouse/touchpad only users. Draggable text
                        </td>
                    <td>Slight highlight similar to drive, recent pop-ups like with TTV
                        Mouse right click works, paste works
                        Same functions as TTV, “enter query” helps learn
                        Best: has a keyboard icon that lets enter letters. Draggable text
                        </td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Keyboard</td>
                    <td>Intuitive to start, made for keyboard inputs
                        Can copy/paste with Ctrl C/Ctrl V. ESC doesn’t stop text, page up/down shortcuts disable the window
                        Same points as for mouse, learnable and easy to recall
                        Tab focuses relatively quickly. After the first search, a bit awkward ordering of search button -> cancel button -> search text
                        </td>
                    <td>Top of the page, easy to use with keyboard
                        Same as with google drive, shortcuts work, ESC doesn’t exit, page up/down disabled
                        Recent history makes it more learnable
                        Tab focuses within a couple of attempts. No changes after first search
                        </td>
                    <td>Same comments, top of the page, easy to find
                        Same as TTV but page up/down work, but still highlight the window
                        Same as TTV. Good balance across all three.
                        Tab gets there quickly. Tab position is not preserved across searches, unlike Twitch
                        </td>

                <tr>
                    <td>Touch</td>
                    <td>Top of the app, easy to find, slightly different buttons
                        After entering search words, can’t browse for other files. Uses more learnable filters
                        Still intuitive, but relies on familiarity with this kind of search bar
                        Nothing noteworthy for accessability
                        </td>
                    <td>New update made it horrible to find. Need to find a search button at the bottom and then it appears at the top
                        No live video prompts while searching
                        New update threw away learnability (as a user of multiple years, I could not find the search bar for a good minute)
                        Nothing noteworthy
                        </td>
                    <td>Search bar is hidden on main page, need to find the loop icon to start
                        As drive, can’t look for other videos while searching
                        Not very learnable for new users since it’s hidden
                        Has a voice input option

                        The first time the page loads, screen reader stops, need to manually adjust to the main page
                        Ordering of search buttons is confusing
                        Not clear what search results gave after pressing enter
                        As you type, reads out suggested dropdowns                        
                        </td>
                    <td>It might be a windows reader problem, but I could not even type with this reader enabled, there were no tips how to do it either
                        A bit better than drive, but still hard to navigate                        
                        </td>
                    <td>No info after page loading
                        Very poor description of the search bar (combo input, scan of space?)
                        Could not use arrows to help with search after typing
                        No info on suggested videos

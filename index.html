        <h2>The Question</h2>
        <p style="width: 80%; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">
          I have never thought much of a search bar component that I interact
          with daily - whether it's YouTube, Wiki, Google Drive or Twitch.
          Everything now has a search bar and it felt straightforward to use
          from day one. However, I also realized that I never experienced a
          mismatch in its design: I am a daily mouse and keyboard user. If you
          remove one of them, how hard can it get? My intuition told me that it
          shouldn't be a problem, so today, we will explore how accessible a
          simple search bar is.

            <p>
              The first part of the experiment is to try out the search bars
              accross different environments. I chose the ones that I use most
              often, Google Drive, YouTube, and Twitch TV searches. To measure
              their accessability, I gave all of them a go with using primarely
              mouse/touchpad, keyboard, or a touchscreen. My main focus points
              were general component behavior, capabilities, how easy it is to
              learn and use, and how accessible it felt. You can find the report
              in the table on the other side.

          Clearly, there is something to be improved here. While some problems
          feel like nitpicking, the screen reader experience was upsetting
          across the board. Let's take a look at how a typical YouTube search bar
          interaction goes in a state model, and find a place for an enhanced
          feature to help screen reader do better.

          <h2>Component Redesign</h2>
          <p style="width: 80%; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">
            One particular point of frustration during the screen reader usage
            was attempting to get to dynamic recommendations based on the query.
            Pressing tab would sometimes skip it, and arrow keys could refuse to
            work, even if prompts are on the screen. Perhaps, the design of the
            page does not provide something for screen reader/tab system to
            "attach to". My proposal: create a hardcoded recommendation line,
            that's a part of the search bar. This way, the "recommendations" are
            always there, and screen reader code can flow from one part of the
            search bar (the actual search) to the recommendations window,
            without skipping to the next element.

        <h2>Reflections on Inclusive Design</h2>
        <p>
          This part is inspired by the video
          <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-iccWRhKZa8&ab_channel=99U"
            >Kat Holmes' Inclusive Design</a
          >.
        </p>
        <h3>Usability and accessability</h3>
        <p style="width: 70%; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">
          Google Drive was the only search bar that failed dragging text into
          the box or right clicking on the bar and pasting the text. 
          I would make sure to use a system that at least supports
          dragging the text into the search bar or pasting by using the mouse.
          Ideally, I would take YouTube’s idea and place a button that opens a
          mini keyboard on the screen that you could use with a mouse.
        </p>
        <h3>Acessability considerations in my design</h3>
        <p style="width: 70%; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">
          The screen reader was a pretty daunting experience across the board,
          mostly because of its cryptic messaging and component order. In my
          design, I tried to make it simple so that the screen reader doesn’t
          get overwhelmed, but also added a small component that would help the
          screen reader be more organized.
        </p>
        <h3>Solving for a mismatch</h3>
        <p style="width: 72%; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">
          This particular mismatch is defined as a mismatch between human
          interactions and design of the application. A mismatch that I
          accounted for is the idea that most users are able to see the search
          bar recommendations results, which is not always true, and screen 
          reader is supposed to help with that!
        </p>
        <h3>Positive and Negative Scenarios</h3>
        <p style="width: 70%; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">
          If a user with a visual impairment would try to use YouTube with a
          screen reader, they would quickly find it nice that using tab gets
          them to the search bar fairly quickly, which is a positive experience. 
          However, if they would try to use the screen reader
          to navigate to recommendations of the their current query, they could
          find it extremely frustrating to find the dropdown
          list without seeing it, which is a negative experience.
        </p>
        <h3>Who is the most commonly prioritized?</h3>
        <p style="width: 70%; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">
          It is easy to understand that the most commonly prioritized components
          are either touch screen (for mobile apps) or mouse/keyboard users.
          Most people use a searchbar either on their phone or on a laptop,
          where both the keyboard and mouse are built-in to the machine.
          Therefore, for the average user, designers and engineers are not
          required to think about what happens when one or the other are
          inaccessible.

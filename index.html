        <p>I have never thought much of a search bar component that I interact with daily - whether it's YouTube, Wiki, Google Drive or Twitch. Everything now has a search bar
            and it felt straightforward to use from day one. However, I also realized that I never experienced a mismatch in its design: I am a daily mouse and keyboard user. If you remove 
            one of them, how hard can it get? My intuition told me that it shouldn't be a problem, so today, we will explore how accessible a simple search bar is.

                    <h2>Input checking</h2>
                    <p>The first part of the experiment is to try out the search bars accross different environments. I chose the ones that I use most often, Google Drive, YouTube, and Twitch TV searches. 
                        To measure their accessability, I gave all of them a go with using primarely mouse/touchpad, keyboard, or a touchscreen. My main focus points were general component behavior, capabilities, 
                    how easy it is to learn and use, and how accessible it felt. You can find the report in the table on the other side.</p>
